I hope I learn something from this project 

## What I learn from this project 
 - How to set up env variables 
 - Bundling Environment Variables for the Browser
 - How to set up to call API using HTTPS
 - How to write Markdown

### Problem occurs for me when Image cannot load cause by unable to load env variables 
 - Solution : Bundling Environment Variables for the Browser 
 - the problem occurs cause the browser cannot read environment variables , I change the env variable to follow next js 

### Learning Markdown 
 - double space to have a soft break 
 - CTRL + SHIFT + V to view the Markdown


### Changing form server side render to client side render in homepage
use usestate and fetch component in different way.
